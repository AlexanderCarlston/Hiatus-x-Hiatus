# Hiatus x Hiatus

## Intro:
Hunter × Hunter (Japanese: ハンター×ハンター Hepburn: Hantā Hantā, abbreviated: HxH) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine and journal since March 3, 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006.

## Back end:
I use a Go API for the backend: https://github.com/AlexanderCarlston/go-api

## Planning: 
Planning is extremely important, so I'm going to start out wireframing before I start writing code. Since this
is going to be only one page there won't be much, but it's still good to do.
